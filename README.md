# AHK_Scripts
After getting used to 60% keyboards with custom layers, a normal notebook layout drives me crazy...

The scripts are a combination of keyboard layers, an autocorrect file and a list of textblocks for quick anwsers. 
The main.ahk is for a startup script. The script can run on startup, because the custom firmware never sends the keycodes, that I use for the layers.
Be sure not to send CapsLock.
